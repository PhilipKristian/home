#### ‘Philipp is without doubt one of the most impressive visionaries I have had the pleasure of working with. He is exceptionally skilled at not just technology, but the human element of innovation. Brilliant.’ – Head of Innovation, Manulife Philippines

Everybody has a plan — until they don’t. Approaching the dawn of a new decade, global sentiment in the 2020s was brimming with optimism. We would embrace the future of work, transform digitally, learn to live and breathe agility, and defeat climate change at scale.

We’re approaching a global turning point. This is our opportunity to finally realise pivotal changes we always knew mattered.
