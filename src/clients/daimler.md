##### Creating a digital target picture for the future of mobility

The leadership team at Daimler Mobility Africa Asia Pacific was looking to engage an innovation leader to help define their regional digital target picture. This was based on a global strategic mandate of accelerating digital transformation. While the client already had significant digital presence, they were seeking holistic perspective with clear priorities and a unified approach. Specifically, they were looking for a senior, expert design thinking and innovation facilitator on this journey through in-person workshops in Singapore.

The engagement brought together eight departments. It uncovered customer journeys and novel digital insights relevant to the current and potential future business. This enabled creating new value propositions and strategic priorities based on current gaps and pain points. Having an experienced masterclass facilitator with deep hands-on digital innovation expertise in Asia Pacific and the APMEA region made a huge difference in this scenario.

Thanks to this high-impact intervention, the client emerged with a clear direction for how to amplify customer value. This resulted in an innovation pipeline for years to come and helped the Singapore regional HQ turn its digital strategy into reality.
