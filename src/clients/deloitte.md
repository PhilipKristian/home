##### ‘Trust is one of the most sought-after values in the financial services. I particularly enjoyed the Trust Economy model, which provides an invaluable framework for organisations to plan and design for trust.’ <br/> – VP, Group Experience Design, OCBC Bank

##### Inspiring CFOs to win in a disruptive world

In 2019, Deloitte China hosted an inaugural client event exploring the future of finance with leading external keynote speakers on innovation, transformation and trust. Aptly titled CFO Vision, the conference took place in Hong Kong and Singapore, both natural choices as Finance and Technology industry hubs in Asia. The flagship event brought together senior leaders and executives across financial services, around the theme of winning in a disruptive world.

A core dimension of this was a conversation on strategically elevating CFO leadership in Asia by understanding digital disruption from the vantage point of a global expert and keynote speaker. Approaching this from the lens of the trust economy and trust in the digital age, the event helped the audience to understand digital trust and the role it played in new technology adoption. For instance, people willingly give their data only to brands they trust – which means the Trust Economy plays a huge role in making the most of the digital economy. In an age where data is a dominant digital currency, we must rethink customer experiences and interactions with trust at the core. The unique consumer behaviour and attitudes in Asia are particularly relevant to this.

Delivering an eye-opening keynote speech on the strategic significance of the Trust Economy, the conversation resonated and rippled throughout the conference and beyond. It further inspired the client to propose additional collaboration opportunities. Trust is an essential ingredient to shaping the future of CFO leadership in financial services across banking, insurance and asset management. The session sparked a genuine mindset shift.

Beyond this immediate effect, the client expanded on their internal thinking around the critical importance of trust. In 2020, they launched a global trust measurement product aligned with the principles and lingo touched upon in the keynote. It’s one of many ways in which the impact of an experienced keynote speaker can outlast a single event. This event positioned the client as a thought leader in the Hong Kong market and beyond.
