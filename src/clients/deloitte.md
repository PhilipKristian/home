## Inspiring CFOs to win in a disruptive world

In 2019, Deloitte China hosted an inaugural client event exploring the future of finance. Aptly titled CFO Vision, the conference took place in Hong Kong. It brought together senior leaders and executives across financial services, centering around the theme of winning in a disruptive world.

A core dimension of this was a conversation on strategically elevating the CFO function in a digital world, brought to the audience by a world-class keynote speaker. What better topic to choose than the trust in the digital age. Understanding digital trust dynamics and The trust Economy at large are pivotal to unlocking the full future potential of organisations and leadership talent.

Delivering an eye-opening keynote speech on the strategic significance of the Trust Economy, the conversation resonated and rippled throughout the conference and far beyond. It further inspired the client to propose additional collaboration opportunities. Making trust an essential ingredient to shaping the future of CFO leadership in financial services across banking, insurance and asset management became an opportunity embraced by attendees, and a genuine mindset shift.

Beyond this immediate effect, the client expanded on their internal thinking around the critical importance of trust. In 2020, they launched a global trust measurement product building on the very principles outlined in the keynote, even continuing the lingo used. Itâ€™s one of many ways by which impact builds beyond a single event. A keynote speaker should always aspire to spark conversation that far outlasts the event itself.
