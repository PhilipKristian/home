##### Building trust leadership into a post-pandemic business growth engine

Salesforce is undoubtedly one of the most trusted and ambitious fast-growing enterprise technology companies in the world. As part of their APAC partner engagement event in Singapore, they were looking for experienced global thought leaders and keynote speakers. Specifically, they needed a keynote speaker offering fresh insight and inspiration to help their strategic distributors achieve more with customer-centricity. This is exactly what a leading speaker bureau is in a position to help with – and this is how Saxton Speakers facilitated a conversation that became a successful partnership.

With a brief to motivate, educate and galvanise a small, hand-selected group of senior executives leading their regional partner organisations, the client aspired to connect their overall growth strategy to the greatly elevated significance of organisational customer trust in the digital economy. In line with an overall horizon of recovery the client wanted to highlight the importance of trust in maximising post-pandemic growth opportunities. As a keynote speaker on trust leadership and the global reset with experience across Singapore and Asia Pacific, the fit was perfect.

The keynote speech really helped set the scene for this global reset and the new playing field. It encouraged the senior leaders present to view their technology leadership through a new, human lens. A great keynote speaker decodes the future to help leaders understand big trends, distill key insights and turn them into business results.
