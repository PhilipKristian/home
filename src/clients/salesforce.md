## Building trust leadership into a post-pandemic business growth engine

Salesforce is undoubtedly one of the most ambitious and fast-growing enterprise technology companies in the world. As part of their APAC partner engagement, they were looking for external thought leadership, insight and inspiration to help their strategic distributors multiply their impact and help their clients achieve more with customer-centricity. This is exactly what a professional keynote speaker can provide.
With a brief to motivate, educate and galvanise a small, hand-selected group of senior executives leading their regional partner organisations, the client aspired to connect their overall growth strategy to the greatly elevated significance of company and customer trust in the digital economy. In line with an overall horizon of recovery across the global economy, the client wanted to clearly highlight the importance of trust in making the most of post-pandemic growth opportunities.
The keynote speech really helped set the scene for the global reset and the new playing field. It encouraged the senior leaders present to view their technology leadership through a new, human lens. A great keynote speaker deciphers big trends and turns them into actionable insight and business results.
