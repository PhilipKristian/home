##### Enhancing South Africa’s Brand as a Destination for Service Excellence

Great customer service is the result of customers trusting a brand. Equally, it is the result of employers and service providers trusting their people to lead with empathy and perform at peak. This is precisely what the Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) and Global Business Services (GBS) sectors in South Africa aspire to become global champions in. Doing so helps thousands of South Africans find gainful employment serving global clients from North America to Europe and Asia.

The client, representing the entire associated industry for South Africa and supported by the KwaZulu Natal regional government, got exposed to the Trust Economy and its role in industry leadership at a conference organised by NASSCOM, the leading business process outsourcing association in India, which had booked Philipp Kristian as a keynote speaker for their event.

The story of trust as the world’s most profound economic power in the digital age resonated so much that the client adapted the programme for their own annual conference aimed at promoting investment in the global business services sector in South Africa. For a keynote speaker with global clients across Asia, Europe and North America, this was an opportunity and invitation to bring the Trust Economy to the African continent.

The conference and keynote were a resounding success, leading to follow-up engagements and praise from government and private sector stakeholders – who were awed by the conferences’ impact and influence on building South Africa’ brand as a leading business process outsourcing and global business services hub.
