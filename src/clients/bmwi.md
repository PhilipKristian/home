The Federal German Government represents one of the world’s true powerhouse economies. In a national push for digital transformation, industry 4.0 and tech innovation, the Federal Ministry of Economics and Energy has been at the forefront of supporting and plugging into the global startup ecosystem.
Building on highly successful efforts in Silicon Valley and other parts of North America, the ministry had set its sights on Singapore, encouraged by strong government support of the local ecosystem. In order to determine the best possible approach and collect insights about the Singapore start-up ecosystem, they reached out to thought leaders and experts with deep expertise building, scaling and supporting start-ups and technology disruptors in Singapore and Southeast Asia region.
As part of this endeavour, the client invited a shortlist of global start-up ecosystem thought leaders and subject matter experts to closed-door conversations in Germany, in order to learn about the best way to move forward. The dialogue fruited in a highly successful and expanding set-up in Singapore, and an ongoing engagement in supporting the efforts and making them the best they could be.
