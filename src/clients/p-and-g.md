##### Driving Customer-Centric Innovation in the Trust Economy

Organisations and brands that trust their customers receive trust in return. The Trust Economy isn’t just a global trend worth embracing – it is an invitation to reconsider the essence of business, brands and humanity. Business is nothing without relationships, and relationships are built on trust. Mutual trust doesn’t just make sense from a commercial point of view, it also helps organisations become purpose-driven and stand up for a worthy cause.

In light of the industry’s major shifts and the many possibilities of the digital economy, the client assembled key thought leaders to inspire ideas for the future of the category, and humanity overall. As part of that, they showed keen interest in the Trust Economy and how it would impact incumbent industries in decades to come.

Unlike most client events, this one was an industry forum open to internal and external individuals excited about building a better future together. It demonstrates how the world’s biggest challenges benefit greatly from shared, collaborative solution approaches. The event was an eye-opener sparking continued conversations on how brand and consumer can work together on building a better material and immaterial world.
