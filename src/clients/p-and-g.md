##### Driving Customer-Centric Innovation in the Trust Economy

Organisations and brands that trust their customers receive trust in return. The Trust Economy isn’t just a global trend worth embracing – it is an invitation to reconsider the essence of business, brands and humanity. Business is nothing without relationships, and relationships are built on trust. Mutual trust doesn’t just make sense from a commercial point of view, it also helps organisations become purpose-driven and stand up for a worthy cause.

In view of major industry shifts and the many possibilities of the digital economy, the client assembled the key thought leaders and TEDx keynote speakers in Singapore to inspire ideas for the future of their category. They showed interest in a keynote on the Trust Economy for their Singapore event, to understand how it would affect incumbent industries in decades to come.

Unlike most client events, this one was an industry forum open to internal and external individuals based in Asia who were excited about building a better future together. The Singapore-based conference was a true eye-opener sparking continued dialogue on how brands and consumers can collaborate on design thinking a better material and immaterial world. An assembly of leading keynote speakers offered a buffet of insight and case studies that made this key theme tangible. This open forum demonstrated that the world’s biggest challenges always benefit greatly from shared, collaborative solution approaches.
