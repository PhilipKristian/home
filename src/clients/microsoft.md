Microsoft products are pivotal to how the world works. As an organization committed to digital transformation and empowering every person and organization to achieve more, Microsoft understands the dynamics involved in adopting new technologies. The company also has a long-standing perspective on trust and the important role trust plays in digital transformation. For their 2018 client showcase event in partnership with DXC.technology, they were looking for a keynote speaker to amplify their digital transformation and trust message.
Bringing together current and future clients of the two organisations, the event provided a red thread of digital transformation leadership spanning cybersecurity, user experience and strategic trust. Often, adoption of cloud and other new technologies makes perfect business sense, but organisations still take time until they are convinced the move is a safe and sound decision. Recognising this human factor, the client demonstrated its commitment to building a trusted digital future by connecting their narrative to a keynote speech on the Trust Economy.  
Not only did this help make trust a tangible transformation asset to people in the room, it also led to follow-up conversations with Microsoft on ways to foster their trust efforts, and how this would promote continued trust leadership for the organisation. A keynote speaker and expert dedicated to their topic will transform businesses for good, and know exactly what it takes.
