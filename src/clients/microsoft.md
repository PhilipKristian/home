##### ‘Fantastic presentation. Thank you, it really resonated with me!’ <br/> – Consultant, PwC

##### Leading Asia’s digital transformation with trust

Microsoft products are pivotal to how the world works. As an organization committed to digital transformation and empowering every person and organization to achieve more, Microsoft understands the dynamics involved in adopting new technologies. The company also has a long-standing perspective on trust and the important role trust plays in digital transformation. For their 2018 client showcase event in partnership with DXC.technology in Singapore and for Asia, they were looking for a top-rated professional keynote speaker to amplify their digital transformation and trust message.

Bringing together current and future clients of the two organisations, the event provided a red thread of digital transformation leadership spanning cybersecurity, user experience and strategic trust. Often, adoption of cloud and other new technologies makes perfect business sense, but organisations – especially in Asia – still take time to consider the move is a safe and sound decision. Recognising this human factor, the client demonstrated its commitment to helping Singapore and the region build a trusted digital future by connecting their narrative to a keynote speech on the Trust Economy.

For the Asia-based attendees, this helped make trust a tangible transformation asset. It helped them understand that in order to thrive in the digital age they had to have trust on their side. It also led to follow-up conversations with Microsoft on ways to foster their trust-builing efforts in Asia Pacific and how it would promote continued trust leadership for the organisation. Having an experienced trust and innovation keynote speaker as a dedicated partner on this journey can help businesses of all shapes and sizes transform for good, and know exactly what it takes to become trust leaders in their industry.
