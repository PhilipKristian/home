##### ‘Your presentation on The Trust Economy blew me away!’ <br/> – CEO, homebot.ai

##### Designing a better data economy with trust at the center

As a primary player in the global data economy, Facebook works with expert speakers and facilitators around the world to guide and inspire thinking on best practices around designing user experiences involving data. Alongside several other engagement points, the client was interested in a keynote speaker delivering a strategic perspective on trust and its connection to emerging data governance principles of transparency and control for an audiences in Asia.

As part of this mandate, the client organised an event focusing on building better digital experiences with and for start-ups in South Korea. Offering them fresh perspective and hands-on guidance, the event kicked off with a 15-minuted TED-style keynote speech on the strategic importance of designing digital experiences for trust, and benefits this would bring to data-driven interactions. This keynote spanned aspects of the digital Trust Economy and its interpretation by leading technology disruptors and digital economy giants.

On top of helping clarify several significant ideas and improvements across these fields, this engagement and its conversations were continued in Singapore, where the client was setting up a forum for start-up engagement and corresponding thought leadership. It evidenced the value-add of trust in designing digital interfaces and the data streams powering them. Building user trust in digital interfaces is a mission-critical factor driving engagement, social sharing and value generation. This is where it is handy to be able to work with a keynote speaker based in Singapore and at home in Asia, who is practical at heart and loves to put new thinking into action.
