##### Designing a better data economy with trust at the center

As a primary player in the global data economy, Facebook works with experts around the world to guide and inspire thinking on best practices around designing user experiences involving data. Alongside several other engagement points, the client was interested in a keynote speaker delivering a strategic perspective on trust and its connection to emerging data governance principles of transparency and control.
As part of this mandate, the client organised an event focusing on building better digital experiences with and for start-ups in Korea. Offering them fresh perspective and hands-on guidance, the event kicked off with a 15-minuted TED-style keynote speech on the strategic importance of designing digital experiences for trust, and benefits this would bring to data-driven interactions. This keynote spanned the Trust Economy and its application by leading technology disruptors and digital economy giants.
On top of helping concretise several significant ideas and improvements across these fields, this engagement also contextualized the value-add of trust in the particular important and sensitive area of digital interfaces â€“ and the data streams powering them. By means of this, it became crystal-clear that user trust in digital interfaces is among the top factors driving engagement, social sharing and value generation for all parties involved. A great keynote speaker will inspire audiences and make them aspire to put new thinking into action.
