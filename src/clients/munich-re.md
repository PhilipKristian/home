##### Reimagining risk for CEOs across Asia

MunichRe is one of the world’s leading reinsurers. On top of that, the company has led the way in the industry on how to collaborate with and enable Insurance Technology (Insurtech) start-ups. Its Digital Partners business is a global lighthouse effort in connecting present and future of the industry.

As part of their thought leadership in and for the Asia region, the client invited CEOs of their leading clients to join an exclusive dialogue on the future of the industry. This regional forum was a flagship event that had been taking place every couple years, bringing together 80-100 CEOs of regional and global insurers in Asia.

In 2016, they reached out to request a keynote speaker on innovation and technology connecting their narrative with the reinsurance and insurance business. The 2016 forum was a particularly special event, as it was the last appearance of 30-year standing global CEO Dr. Nikolaus von Bomhardt, who attended the full event in person.

The keynote speech, which Philipp Kristian built around the theme of Redefining Risk, was met by outstanding reviews, kicking-off several follow-up conversations with MunichRe and its key clients. It led to several further speaking engagements, advisory RFPs and endorsements. Diverse industry expertise empowers an experienced keynote speaker to offer depth and breadth that connects with and expands audiences’ horizons. The Singapore event was correspondingly met with praise, allowing MunichRe to deepen its strong client relationships in Asia.
